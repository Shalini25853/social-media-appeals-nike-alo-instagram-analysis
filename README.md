#  Instagram Engagement Analysis – Nike & Alo Yoga

This project compares the effectiveness of **emotional vs rational appeals** in Instagram content by **Nike** and **Alo Yoga**. It uses engagement data (likes, comments) to evaluate how brand messaging influences audience response and builds content recommendations based on user behavior.

---

##  Objective

To assess how different content types impact engagement and:
- Identify which messaging strategy—**emotional** or **rational**—performs better
- Provide **content planning guidance** for brand marketing teams
- Use data-backed analysis to align future posts with audience preferences

---

##  Methodology

- Collected data from 20 recent Instagram posts per brand
- Manually labeled content as **emotional** or **rational**
- Analyzed:
  - Engagement metrics (likes, comments)
  - Word usage and theme categories
  - Content format (video, image, carousel)

---

## Key Findings

- **Emotional Appeals** (e.g., motivational, inclusive, wellness) generated the highest engagement — with **correlation coefficients of 0.7–0.8**
- **Nike’s athlete storytelling posts** and **Alo Yoga’s self-care messages** were top performers
- Rational posts (e.g., durability, features, pricing) showed **weaker or negative correlations**
- Content engagement is **right-skewed**, with top emotional posts as outliers
